# NBodySimulation

This project is a Python simulation of a gravitational **three-body system**, featuring two stars and a planet. It uses **Velocity Verlet integration** for numerical stability and allows visualization of the trajectories over time.

## Features

- Simulation of gravitational interactions between multiple bodies
- Accurate position and velocity updates using Velocity Verlet method
- Trajectory animation using `matplotlib`
- Easily extendable to more bodies or different initial conditions

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib`

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
