# NBodySimulation

This project is a Python simulation of a gravitational **three-body system**, featuring two stars and a planet. It uses **Velocity Verlet integration** for numerical stability and allows visualization of the trajectories over time.

## Features

- Simulation of gravitational interactions between multiple bodies
- Accurate position and velocity updates using Velocity Verlet method
- Trajectory animation using `matplotlib`
- Easily extendable to more bodies or different initial conditions

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib`

How to run the simulation:
1) Clone GitHub repo

```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/srajbis/NBodySimulation](https://github.com/srajbis/NBodySimulation)
   cd NBodySim

2) Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib

3) Run simulation with this command:

```bash
python main.py

NOTE: Body properties can be edited in main.py file
